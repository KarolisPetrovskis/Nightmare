# Nightmare

Nightmare is a university project for a **Software Architecture** course.

The project delivers a unified SaaS platform for **small and medium businesses** in two sectors:

- **Catering:** bars, cafés, restaurants
- **Beauty:** barbers, hairdressers, SPA salons

The system supports functionality for both domains, with feature access controlled by each customer’s **subscription plan**.

Nightmare is designed to be operated entirely by **business employees** and **managers**.
